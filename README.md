# Snapdeal Clone

Snapdeal is an Indian online e-commerce website.
 People can search and find products of their
 choice and order them. The variety of products include clothing, accessories, kitchen-ware, jewellery etc.
 
 In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of Snapdeal. It was a team effort of 4 members completed within a week.
